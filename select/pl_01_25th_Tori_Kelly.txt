Don't you know that Christmas
would be incomplete
If you're not here with me
Sugar plums ain't half
as sweet as you
Someone go tell Santa
I don't need no gifts
Got nothing on my list
Don't you know
my only wish is
to hold you on the 25th?
Season's here, lights appear
Spread the cheer everywhere,
what a year it has been
Got me dreamin'
Oh, the place where we're safe
From the cold, your embrace
Oh, I just can't wait
To be home again
Catch the midnight flight
No more silent nights
I'll be by your side
Oh
Don't you know that Christmas
would be incomplеte
If you're not herе with me
Sugar plums ain't half
as sweet as you
Someone go tell Santa
I don't need no gifts
Got nothing on my list
Don't you know my only wish
is to hold you on the 25th?
Fa-la-la-la-la
Oh
Fa-la-la-la-la
Yeah, yeah
Hold you on the 25th
Fancy bags, Cadillacs
None of that, keep the tags
I can do without
I just want one thing
Fireside burnin' bright
Mistletoe hangin' high,
my only desire
If you're listening
Catch the midnight flight
No more silent nights
It's been the longest time
Oh, yeah
Don't you know that Christmas
would be incomplete
If you're not here with me
Sugar plums ain't half
as sweet as you
Someone go tell Santa
I don't need no gifts
Got nothing on my list
Don't you know my only wish
is to hold you on the 25th?
Fa-la-la-la-la
Oh
Fa-la-la-la-la
No, no, no
I just want to hold you
on the 25th
So catch the midnight flight
No more silent nights
I'll be by your side
Don't you know that Christmas
would be incomplete
That Christmas, oh, yeah
If you're not here with me
If you're not here with me,
baby
Sugar plums ain't half
as sweet as you
You
Someone go tell Santa
I don't need no gifts
Tell him I don't need no gifts
Got nothing on my list
Oh
Don't you know my only wish
My only wish
Is to hold you on the 25th?
I just wanna hold you, baby
Fa-la-la-la-la
Oh
Fa-la-la-la-la
I just wanna hold you, baby
Ha
Hold you on the 25th
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Fa-la-la-la-la
So get over here, babe
Oh, yeah
